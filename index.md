### About me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, San Diego. I am luckily adivised by Dr. Mikhail Belkin. 
I am interested in machine learning theory. Recently I have focused on understanding optimization and generalization for wide neural networks.

### Papers

- Quadratic models for understanding neural network dynamics
- Transition to Linearity of General Neural Networks with Directed Acyclic Graph Architecture
- Transition to Linearity of Wide Neural Networks is an Emerging Property of Assembling Weak Models
- On the linearity of large non-linear models: when and why the tangent kernel is constant
- Loss landscapes and optimization in over-parameterized non-linear systems and neural networks
