### About me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, San Diego. I am luckily adivised by Dr. Mikhail Belkin. 
I am interested in machine learning theory. Recently I have focused on understanding optimization and generalization for wide neural networks.
