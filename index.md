### About me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, San Diego. I am luckily adivised by [Dr. Mikhail Belkin](http://misha.belkin-wang.org/). 
I am interested in machine learning theory. Recently I have focused on understanding optimization and generalization for wide neural networks.
